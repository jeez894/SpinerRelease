## 🌕 Normal Mode

The Spiner patrols quietly until it spots a player.
Once locked, it enters Stalking mode, silently following and building tension.
When its stalking meter is full, it transitions into Kidnapping, grabs the player, and begins Transport.
If all other players die during this time, it eventually releases the captive and flees (Runaway).

## 🌑 Dark Mode

After being killed once, the Spiner resurrects in a faster, deadlier form.
During transport, it starts a lethal countdown — when the timer hits zero, the victim is instantly executed before the creature returns to Patrol.
If the player drifts too far or disconnects, the Spiner releases them and enters Runaway mode.
